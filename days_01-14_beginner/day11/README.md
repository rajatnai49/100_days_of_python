### Here are the basic rules of Blackjack:

1. Blackjack is played with one or more standard 52-card decks, and each card has a point value.

2. The goal of the game is to have a hand that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, without going over 21.

3. Each player starts with two cards, which are dealt face-up, while the dealer gets two cards, with one card face-up and one card face-down.

4. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, while face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points each. An Ace can be worth either 1 or 11 points, depending on which value would be more beneficial to the player.

5. After the initial deal, players can choose to "hit" (take another card), "stand" (keep their current hand), "double down" (double their original bet and take one more card), or "split" (if they have two cards of the same value, they can separate them into two separate hands).

6. The dealer must follow a specific set of rules regarding when to hit or stand. Typically, the dealer must hit until their hand is at least 17 points, then they must stand.

7. If a player's hand exceeds 21 points, they lose (called "busting"). If the dealer busts, all remaining players win.

8. If a player's hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand, they win. If the dealer's hand is closer to 21, or if the player busts, the dealer wins.

9. If a player is dealt an Ace and a 10-point card (10, Jack, Queen, or King) on their first two cards, they have a "blackjack" and win automatically, unless the dealer also has a blackjack, in which case the game is a tie (called a "push").

10. Betting and payout rules can vary, so it's important to know the specific rules of the casino or game you are playing.

Remember, the goal of Blackjack is to have fun and enjoy the game. Good luck!
